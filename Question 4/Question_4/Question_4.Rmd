# ---------- References settings:
# You can download cls format here: https://www.zotero.org/ - simply search for your institution. You can also edit and save cls formats here: https://editor.citationstyles.org/about/
# Hit download, store it in Tex/ folder, and change reference below - easy.
bibliography: Tex/ref.bib       # Do not edit: Keep this naming convention and location.
csl: Tex/harvard-stellenbosch-university.csl # referencing format used.
# By default, the bibliography only displays the cited references. If you want to change this, you can comment out one of the following:
#nocite: '@*' # Add all items in bibliography, whether cited or not
# nocite: |  # add specific references that aren't cited
#  @grinold2000

linestretch: 1.2                # Set distance between lines.
link-citations: TRUE            # This creates dynamic links to the papers in reference list.

### Adding additional latex packages:
# header-includes:
#    - \usepackage{colortbl} # Add additional packages here.

output:

    fig_height: 3.5
abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(tidyverse)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
import_multiple_rds("data/olympics/.")
```

There are more non-mixed than mixed, so gonna group by gender

```{r}
data<-join_olympics(winter, summer) %>% 
    metal_weightings_summation() %>% 
    left_join(GDP, by = c("Country" = "Code")) 

```

```{r}

data %>% plot_olympics()

```


SO we modify the question


```{r}

            medal_weighting = case_when(
                Medal == "Gold" ~ 4 / n_medals,
                Medal == "Silver" ~ 2 / n_medals,
                TRUE ~ 1 / n_medals
            )
        ) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        select(-n_medals)%>%
        group_by(Country, Year) %>%  # Include Year
        summarise(Medals = sum(medal_weighting, na.rm = TRUE),.groups = 'drop')

```
