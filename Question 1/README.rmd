# Question 1


```{r Setup, Include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:

library(tidyverse)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
import_multiple_rds()
```

```{r ranking baby names, include=FALSE}
rankednames <- Baby_Names_By_US_State %>% get_name_rank_per_gender_n_year() %>% #ranking baby names to compute spearman correlation,Rankings are done on all names of that year, per gender.
    add_growth_of_name_variable() #growths are used to isolate biggest growths year on year
```

Refer to Figure \ref{spearplot}


```{r Spearman Correlation Plot, fig.cap="Spearman Correlation\\label{spearplot}",warnings=FALSE}
rankednames %>%    plot_spearman_graph()
```
What i need to do now is isolate the variables.
What i want to do is look for the instances where the 





```{r ridge plots,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Biggest Year-on-Year growth for Baby Names"}

rankednames %>% get_top_n_growth_names(15,TOP = 120) %>% fill_missing_years() %>% plot_ridge_names()
    

```


```{r table of names that are found in music charts}
unique((rankednames %>% get_top_n_growth_names(15,TOP = 120))$Name) %>% 
    find_top_names(rankednames,charts) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```
